自上而下開發 App -> TodoList -> Todo -> AddTodo -> Footer  

App.js `rcc` 
> extensions Reactjs code snippets  


State 代表UI的完整且最小的狀態集合  
是否可以透過其他state或props計算得到? 可以，為冗餘狀態(非最小) 非state

Todo State
> 待辦事項列表 新增輸入框中的文本  當前篩選條件

如果某個state被多個組件依賴，尋找共同的父組件(狀態上移) 

state 
App.js `todos` `filter` state   
AddTodo.js `text` state

redux
```
{
    text: '',
    todos: [
        {
            id: 1,
            text:'學習react',
            completed: true
        }
    ],
    filter:'all'
}
```
學會定義react state 再去定義 redux

actions 描述如何修改狀態

### Note

Q: `onClick={onClick}` Line 8:  'onClick' is not defined  no-undef  
> `const { completed, text, onClick } = this.props;` or `onClick={this.onClick}` 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
